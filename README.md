## Phase 1: Building a Basic Autonomous Research Agent
- As a part of this phase, I used the `arXiv` API to fetch research papers on a user input topic.
- I also used Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for the papers.
- Then I utilized ChromaDB to store the embeddings and perform similarity search.
- Also Built UI using gradio for the same.

### Phase 1: ArXiv | IEEE APIs
- As a part of this phase, I used the `arXiv` API to fetch research papers on a user input topic.
### Phase 2: Sentence Transformers | ChromaDB | Gradio
- I also used Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for the papers.
- Then I utilized ChromaDB to store the embeddings and perform similarity search.
- Also Built UI using gradio for the same.
### Phase 3: Gemini | Recommendation
- Using gemini to brainstorma few gaps that we can research on.
- Based on research papers that came up using past two phases

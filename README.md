### Phase 1: Fetching papers from arXiv api and adding fallback code to switch to ieee
- As a part of this phase, I used the `arXiv` API to fetch research papers on a user input topic.
### Phase 2: Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings and chromaDB to store embeddings as vectors + UI for user i/o
- I also used Sentence Transformers to generate embeddings for the papers.
- Then I utilized ChromaDB to store the embeddings and perform similarity search.
- Also Built UI using gradio for the same.
